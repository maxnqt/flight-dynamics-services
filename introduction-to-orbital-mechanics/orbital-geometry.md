# Orbital geometry

- Four conic sections: circles, ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas
- Gravity turn: Technique of optimizing a trajectory of a rocket so that it attains the desired path (_launches vertically, then gradually increases tilt until it achieves orbit around the earth_)

## Eliptical orbits

- Most common orbits because one object is "captured" and orbits another larger object
- The velocity in elliptical orbits is always less than that needed to escape from the central object’s influence
