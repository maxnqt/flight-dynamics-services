# How to learn

- If you don’t immediately succeed with a skill, make time for extra explanations and practice
- Learning anything can be made easier if you take the time to break it down and build up from the parts
- Don't avoid your weaknesses/weak areas
- When you’re struggling with a subject, focus on background knowledge
- Filling in any gaps in that background knowledge will expand your ability to juggle new information, give you stronger “hooks” to latch new knowledge onto and effectively make you smarter in the field of your choice

---

- Never just remember how to do something, understand how it works
- Once you can reason about something in your mind you can contemplate why it is the way it is, you can apply your entire creative mind to making the most of it, and you can implement and question improvement
- You have to ask questions at every level, you have to think like the person who made it, and sometimes there'll be nobody to answer your questions

---

- Replace the belief "I’m bad at X" with "I haven’t learned about X yet"
- Identify what you don’t understand (maybe the most important one)
  - Have a clear sense of what you understand
  - Replace "I’m confused, I don’t get it" with "I have a specific question about X"
  - Get better at breaking down what’s confusing to you
- Have confidence in your knowledge
  - Taking a bit of extra time to take a piece of knowledge that you’re pretty sure of and make it totally ironclad
  - Things you know are 100% true are way easier to rely on
- Ask _good_ questions
  - Ask questions that are easy to answer; help the person explain what they know efficiently and guide them to telling you the stuff your interested in
  - State what you understand about the subject so far and ask "is that right?"
  - Ask questions where the answer is a fact/straightforward
  - Stop the person when you don't understand something, ask them to clarify
  - Identify terms you don’t understand, then ask people to help you understand what each of the terms means and the relationships between them (**write a dictionairy of all the terms**, and understand what they really mean)
  - Do some research before asking someone a question
  - Decide who to ask: Is this a good time for this person? Will asking them this question save me as much time as it takes them? How much time will it take them to answer my questions? (maybe block of time with them later); Is this person too senior for this question?
  - Ask questions to show what’s not obvious: Ask questions to reveal hidden assumptions or knowledge ("how")
  - Answering questions from people who are learning the stuff you just learned can be a really awesome way to solidify your knowledge
- Do research
  - Be good at Googling
  - Know where the best documentation is in your area (e.g., man page, documentation, book, blog)
  - Find books that have the information you need
- Recognize that being confused means you’re about to learn something:
  - Recognize that you're confused
  - Figure out what the topic you're confused about is
  - Turn that confusion into concrete questions
  - Ask someone or research to get the answers

- Intense focus enables rapid learning progress
- Eliminate distractions, learn the hardest parts first, drive at your weaknesses and invest concrete chunks of time
- Self-education is results-driven: It doesn’t matter which resources you use, as long as you get to the point
- Optimize for faster learning optimizes for being completely engaged with learning
- Designing your own ultralearning project has three parts:
  - Figuring out what you want to learn deeply, intensely and quickly
  - Choosing which format you want for your project
  - Preparing to start learning
- What do you want to ultralearn?
  - Only pick one thing at a time
  - Shorter projects need more constraints (focus on something specific to make progress noticeable)
  - Pick the direction you want to learn and choose a target (e.g. goal, deadline) when you’re about one-third to halfway done the project
- Choose the format
  - Full-time: Most intense, most costly, fastest; good if you’re between jobs, classes or otherwise can devote yourself to the project
  - Fixed-schedule: Have concrete hours you’ll devote to them every week (e.g., an hour each day before work, two hours before bed, or two 5-hour bursts on the weekend)
  - Fixed-hour projects: Don’t have a particular schedule, but have a number of hours (3, 5, 20) that you’ll put in each week wherever you can find time in your schedule
- Prepare to learn
  - Don’t start right away, gather material, research different learning strategies for your particular skill or subject, plan out your time and conduct a pilot test of the schedule
  - Research how learning works best for that particular domain
  - Hunt around for all the possible learning methods, strategies and recommendations
  - Note common themes and complaints people make
  - Note also alternative strategies that differ
  - Gives you a good idea of how you want to learn, as well as backup options in case your first approach fails you
  - Gather material and design a preliminary attack plan
  - Order books online if you need them
  - Sign up for online courses
  - Get tools, material and equipment if you need any
  - Then create a simple plan for approaching them to learn (e.g., (1) qatch/read, (2) practice questions, (3) feynman technique)
  - Conduct a pilot week of the schedule, test it out
  - See how it fits into your life and get a sense of how difficult it will be
  - If it is too hard, or your schedule is unrealistic, now is the time to adjust it

- Organize your time better and eliminate interruptions in your work can save a few hours of productive time (attention and focus > time)
- Make working on your project a habit
- Set up a concrete time to invest in your project every day
- Try to make it as consistent as possible with your schedule so that working on the project will be relatively automatic
- Make what you learn important: What would have major benefits to you if you could complete the ultralearning
- Hard learning activities requires enormous focus and energy
- To focus well, you need three parts: environmental design, self-monitoring and progressive training
- Design an environment for doing your ultralearning which doesn’t have distractions or temptations: Select a new environment that is mostly disconnected already + build the skill of focusing on top of creating a focus-friendly environment
- Rules of thumb to help you think about focusing better:
  - If you catch your mind wandering, don’t feel guilty, just let it naturally gravitate back to the subject
  - If you feel like quitting, look at the time and set a deadline to allow yourself to take a break if you can reach it
  - If you hit your deadline and you still can’t focus, take a smart break (boring, mentally quiet tasks that allow you to relax your mind without risking opening up new distractions)
  - If you can’t focus because you’re frustrated, talk out loud about the problem
  - If you can’t focus because you’re bored, make the learning activity you’re doing more active
  - Feeling sleepy/angry/strained/drained/etc.? Mentally take a step back and let the feeling pass
- Anyone who struggles with focusing should practice meditation
- Progressively improve your focus: You will get better is through conditioning

- <mark>If your goal is to learn a skill you intend to use, then you should start closer to bottom-up and shift to top-down only later</mark>
- <mark>Start by learning via a particular goal; once you’re pretty good, then start to introduce more top-down theory to round out your knowledge</mark>
- When you get stuck, look for advice on your specific weakness
- Once you’re decent and stop improving as fast, learn more about the theory behind it
- All of this assumes your goal is to learn a practical skill
- If your learning goal is more abstract knowledge in the first place (e.g., math) it’s probably not possible to learn bottom-up
- Bottom-up learning also requires more confidence and motivation
- Starting directly from a real-use situation when your ability is quite low can feel daunting; get through that initial frustration period

- <mark>Learn faster with the Feynman technique</mark>
- Understand ideas you don't really get
- Use this approach to better remember concepts you already understand
- Feynman technique:
  - Choose the concept you want to understand
  - Explain the idea of the concept to yourself as if you're teaching it to someone that has no understanding of it/doesn't know it
  - If you get stuck, go back to the learning material and reread/relearn until you can exlain it
  - For everything "too wordy" or complex you write, simplify or come up with an analogy
 
---

- Get the most of the Feynman technique
- Apply the technique selectively; whenever:
  - You can't successfully apply a concept to practice
  - The idea doesn't make sense to you
  - And you know the idea is central to understanding the larger topic/class
- Cover the material, then do relevant practice, and only when the above is met, use the Feynman technique
- Use the Feynman technique to "repair" misunderstanding or fill in a gap in your knowledge that is causing confusion (first, identify your confusion)
- Focus on big ideas for memorability: Confusing explanations are those, whose links between key steps of reasoning have not solidified
- Don't substitute self-explanations for practice: Explanation $\neq$ practice problems (unless you hit an impass during a practice problem)
- Use the knowledge of your gaps to seek out new explanations (fill in missing prerequisites)
- Teach to learn: Make sense of newly learned information, understanding through writing

---

- Flow-based notetaking: Ideally rovides a surface for connecting and linking ideas as they are reaching you (not the linear, bullet-point style of notes that most people use)
- You start by only writing out the major ideas using a few words at most instead of entire sentences
- Facts, dates, details and descriptions are reduced to just a few words, not lengthy paragraphs
- Next, draw a few arrows to connect it to other ideas
- Represent the ideas as being interrelated components
- Metaphor, diagraming and information compression are methods that can be used in conjunction with flow-based notetaking to enhance understanding
- Remember that notes are only an intermediate step towards understanding
- Sacrifice some later readability, for current understanding
- By reducing the content of your notes and adding links or diagrams, the material can be learned more holistically
- If a class has a high information density or you plan to review notes thoroughly later, there are hybrid strategies you can pursue
  - Approach #1: Take regular notes first and then recopy them into a flow-based format
  - Approach #2 (high information density): Flow-based commenting: Write down the key information and insert links into your notes when there is a break
- Key: Know what is important - What the core information taught here?
- Cut down the amount of information you transcribe and emphasize on connecting and sorting that information in a way you understand

---

- Note-taking is often easier and more natural when you’re listening to something, than when you’re reading
- Why are you reading it in the first place? Why are you trying to take notes? What are you hoping to achieve?
