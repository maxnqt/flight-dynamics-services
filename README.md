# Flight Dynamics Services

Capturing what I’m actively learning, building, and thinking about while working on Flight Dynamics Services at Loft Orbital.

## L3 (entry-level)

- [ ] Scope: Works on clearly defined tasks with a duration of less than two weeks, requiring minimal guidance on execution
- [ ] Impact: Responsible for the entire lifecycle of small-to-medium-sized features
- [ ] Skills: Possesses foundational knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and is learning to apply it to production systems
- [ ] Growth: Focused on moving toward L4 (mid-level) by taking on more ambiguity and technical ownership
- [ ] Accountability: Provides on-call support for features they have developed
- [ ] Mindset: Curious, seeking feedback, and understanding their product's overall strategy

## L4 (mid-level)

- [ ] Autonomy: Operates with minimal guidance, unblocking themselves, and delivering project tasks on time
- [ ] Technical design: Moves beyond implementing tickets to designing components and, in some cases, small systems
- [ ] Project ownership: Leads features end-to-end, managing project scope, and collaborating with stakeholders
- [ ] Engineering craft: Maintains high code quality, participates in code reviews, improves testing coverage, and aids in debugging
- [ ] Influence: Mentors junior engineers (L3) and contributes to better engineering practices

## L5 (senior)

- [ ] Scope & autonomy: Leads major, complex projects, defining technical requirements and architecture with little supervision
- [ ] Technical impact: Identifies necessary improvements to systems, codes, and design, often taking responsibility for a specific product or area's health
- [ ] Behavioral shift: Moves from task-based work (L4) to owning outcomes, planning, and mentoring (L5)
- [ ] Collaboration: Acts as a liaison between engineering and non-engineering teams (product, design) to ensure project success
