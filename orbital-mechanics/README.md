- Goldilocks zone is a region around a star where temperatures are ideal for water to pool on its surface (Sawe, 2017)
- Free-fall environment of space: means there are no contact forces on the body
- In the case of satellites in orbit, the satellite is falling toward the earth because of gravity, but it is continually missing the earth because of its forward speed and the earth’s curvature (microgravity)
- In microgravity, crystal structures tend to grow larger and with fewer impurities than they do on the surface
- Most satellite communication systems operate from geostationary or geosynchronous orbits
- GEO orbits are at an altitude of about 35,800 km (22,250 miles)
- Satellites at that altitude with an inclination, or orbital tilt of 0º are called geostationary
- Those at an inclination other than zero are called geosynchronous
- Also sun-synchronous orbits

## Types of space missions

**Space-based communication**

- Tracking and Relay Data Satellite System: network of satellites and ground stations that allow spacecraft to communicate with the ground as needed
- Mobile User Objective System: ultra-high frequency (UHF) satellite communication system developed for the US Navy (provides voice, video, and mission data on a high-speed Internet protocol-based system)
- Wideband Global Satcom System: US satellite constellation that provides military communication around the globe (provides the primary communication for the Department of Defense)
- Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program: constellation of communication satellites operated by the US Space Force (joint service communications system that provides survivable, global, secure, protected, and jam resistant communications for high priority military ground, sea, and air assets)

**Remote sensing**

- **Landsat**: US satellite system that shows Earth from space (data on forests, urban areas, and fresh water)
- Its data is freely available and has helped us to better understand environmental changes, manage agricultural activities, allocate water resources, and respond to natural disasters
- **SPOT** (Satellite pour l’Observation de la Terre): provide high resolution optical imagery (since 1986)
- Consists of five satellites and has revealed the surface of the Earth in enough detail that it has led to new applications in mapping, vegetation monitoring, land use and land cover, and the impacts of natural disasters
- **SBIRS** (Space-Based Infrared Radar System): US space surveillance system that provides key capabilities in the areas of missile warning, missile defense, and defensive and offensive space characterization
- Consists of satellites in geostationary orbits and highly elliptical orbits. It can identify a missile’s trajectory and provide real-time information to develop an appropriate defense strategy
- Has sensitive infrared sensors that enable identification of missile types and has extremely precise prediction accuracy.
- **Sentinel-3**: satellite to measure ocean surface topography, ocean and land surface temperatures, and ocean and land surface colors
- Supports ocean forecasting systems, environmental monitoring, and climate monitoring

**Navigation**

- Global Positioning System (GPS): used for tracking, mapping, and timing for precision agriculture, transportation, and defense purposes
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS): uses 24 satellites to provide worldwide services (located in medium, circular orbits at an altitude of approximately 19,100 km [14,430 miles], and at an orbital inclination, or tilt of 64.8°)
- Galileo: Europe’s global navigation system; interoperable with GPS and GLONASS, and the complete constellation will consist of twenty-four operational satellites in medium Earth orbit at 23,222 km altitude and an inclination of 56°

**Explore our solar system and beyond**

- The Cassini mission to Saturn made numerous discoveries, including the extraordinary weather patterns at the north pole. The hexagon shape comes from a six-sided jet stream that spans about 30,000 km (20,000 miles) across
- Voyager 1 is in interstellar space, the space between the stars, while Voyager 2 is still exploring the outer layer of the solar bubble
- These missions are continuing to characterize the outer solar system environment and search for our heliopause boundary, the outer limits of the Sun’s magnetic field and outward flow of the solar wind
- It is believed the Voyagers have enough electrical power and thrust fuel to keep their current science instruments on until at least 2025
