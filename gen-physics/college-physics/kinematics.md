# Kinematics

**Prerequisites**

- **Scalars:** Quantities with magnitude (_size_) only (e.g., mass, distance, speed, volume, temperature, energy)
- **Vectors:** Quantitis with magnitude _and_ direction
- Vector notation: Arrow over the symbol for the quantity
  - Position: $\vec{x}$
  - Displacement: $\Delta\vec{x}$
  - Velocity: $\vec{v}$
  - Acceleration: $\vec{a}$
- Drawing vectors by hand: Rough sketch, scale relative to each other, label magnitudes
- Arrow’s point is the tip (or head), the opposite end is the tail
- **A vector can be moved anywhere in space** without changing its meaning, as long as its magnitude and direction stay the same
- Note: Don't add vectors that represent different types of quantities
- Note: Clearly define your coordinate system before doing any calculations with vectors

## Position, speed, velocity

- $\Delta$ represents a change in a variable (e.g., difference between final and initial value)
- Position: "Location _relative to a chosen reference frame_," vector with both magnitude and direction
- $\vec{x}$ is often used to represent horizontal position, $\vec{y}$ for vertical position
- If an object moves relative to its reference frame, the object’s position changes
- **Displacement:** Change in position (vector): $\Delta \vec{x} = \vec{x} - \vec{x}\_{0}$ where $\Delta \vec{x}$ is the displacement, $\vec{x}$ the final/current position, and $\vec{x}_{0}$ the initial position
- Since position is a vector, displacement is also a vector
- We can simplify our equation by removing the vector notation (note that these are vector quantities): $\Delta x = x - x\_{0}$
- Distance travelled: Total path length (a scalar)
- Distance $\neq$ displacement: If an object changes direction in its journey, the total distance traveled will be greater than the displacement between those two points
- Velocity: "How quickly the position changes," i.e. change in position per unit of time, vector quantity: $\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}}$
- (Average) Speed: "How quickly the distance is traveled," scalar: $v = \frac{|\Delta \vec{x}|}{\Delta t} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$

## Motion and object model

- Kinematics: Describing motion, without considering why the motion is happening
- Object: Something for which the internal structure is not important to the situation
- Object model: Represent motion visually and simply; particle is the dot that represents an object (particle diagram); dots sho where the objects is after amounts of time
- Particle diagram is a qualitative diagram, useful for visualizing how the position of the object is changing over time
- For quantitative (numeric) information, we need to add a reference frame and define the elapsed time between each successive set of dots
- Motion diagrams combine particle diagrams with vector arrows to represent various motion quantities (e.g., velocity where a 'v” appears above each arrow to denote velocity)

## Instantaneous speed and velocity

- Instantaneous speed: Speed at a given moment in time
- Instantaneous velocity: Velocity at a given moment in time

$$V_{instantaneous} = lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{x(t + h) - x(t)}{h} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$
