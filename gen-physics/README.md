## Motion and forces

### Speed and velocity

- $speed = \frac{distance}{time}$ with a unit of distance per time (no acceleration)
- Graphing speed: distance (y-axis), time (x-axis), slope (graph)
- $slope = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{change in y}{change in x}$
- Velocity: speed _with a direction_

### Acceleration

- Whenever an object's velocity changes, it's accelerating
- Acceleration: _how quickly the velocity (speed, direction) changes_
- Acceleration has a direction as well (!)
- At a steady rate (no change in velocity), acceleration is $0$

### Reference frames

- Motion is _relative_ to reference frames (i.e., motion has no _absolute_ meaning)
- All reference frames are equally valid
- E.g., constant velocity in one frame of reference could mean rest in another frame of reference

### Describing motion

- Position measures the length and direction of a straight line from a reference point to an object's location
- _Position_ can be described with two additional pieces of information
  - An object’s straight-line distance from the reference point
  - An object’s direction from the reference point
- _Distance_ measures the length of the path travelled between two points (doesn't include direction)
- _Speed_ is a measure of how fast an object is moving
- _Velocity_ is also a measure of how fast an object moves, but it also gives the direction the object moves
- _Acceleration_ is a measure of how quickly an object’s velocity changes
- An object is accelerating if its speed, direction, or both are changing
- Information about an object’s motion must include the reference frame and units used

### Forces

- Force $\approx$ push or pull
- The strength of a force is measured in units of newtons ($N$)
- A force has an amount (_strength_) and a direction
- **Contact force:** two surfaces are in contact with each other while force is exerted; when the contact is lost, the force disappears
- Examples of contact force: normal force (perpendicular to the surface), applied force (perpendicular to the surface), friction (parallel to the surface)
- Two object exerting a force on each other through contact is called an _interaction_ (contact interaction)
- A push or pull from an interaction between two objects is called a _force_
- An object can’t change its motion by pushing or pulling on itself
- **Non-contact force:** exerted without being in/having a contact (e.g., gravity, electric force, magnetic force)
- Any two masses will exert a force of gravity on each other
- **Net force (or total force):** all forces applied to an object with their respective directions added up (same direction adds up, opposite direction cancels out)

---

- A contact force pair results from two objects touching each other. Two types of contact forces are described below.
A normal force pair is produced when two surfaces press against each other. Each normal force acts perpendicular \[(\perp)\] to the surface it’s applied to. (In math, normal means perpendicular.) For example, a normal force pair is produced when the girl stands on the skateboard.
The right half of a skateboard is shown with the bottom part of a person's leg standing on it. An arrow starts at the person's shoe and points upward. It is labeled F normal, skateboard on foot. An equal-length arrow starts from the skateboard, directly below the foot and points downward. It is labeled F normal, foot on skateboard.
A friction force pair resists two surfaces sliding against each other. Each friction force acts parallel \[(\parallel)\] to the surface it’s applied to, opposite the direction it's sliding (or attempting to slide) relative to the other surface. For example, a friction force pair is produced when a skateboard skids across the ground to slow down.
- A non-contact force pair involves two objects that can interact without touching.
A gravitational force pair pulls any two objects with mass toward each other. The pull is very weak unless one or both of the masses are very large, like the Earth. In our everyday experience, the only gravitational forces strong enough to notice are those of the Earth interacting with other objects. For example, when a skater performs a jump, he’s not touching Earth’s surface. But the Earth still pulls him back towards the ground.
- The electric and magnetic forces are also non-contact forces
- When more than one force acts on an object at the same time, it’s helpful to think about their combined effect—the net force. The net force is the strength and direction of a force that could replace all the individual forces acting on an object and have the same effect.
When determining the net force on an object, we only consider forces that act on that object. So, even though every force is part of a pair, we only model the one force from the pair that acts on the object we're analyzing.
- Whenever the forces on an object completely cancel out, giving a net force of zero, we say the forces are balanced. If the net force is not zero, the forces are unbalanced
- Sometimes, forces aren’t in the same or opposite directions. They may point in different dimensions
- We can’t just add or subtract the strengths of these three forces. Instead, we have to look separately at the horizontal (side-to-side) forces and the vertical (up-and-down) forces
- The vertical forces are in opposite directions, so we subtract their strengths

---

- A force is a push or pull. Its strength is measured in newtons \[(\text{N}).\]
A force can be modeled with an arrow. The arrow’s length represents the strength of the force.
All forces are produced by two objects interacting. Each of the two objects puts a force on the other.
Newton’s third law says if objects A and B interact, A exerts a force on B, and B exerts an equal-strength force on A, but in the opposite direction.
Contact forces require contact between objects. Examples are normal and friction forces.
Non-contact forces can act without contact. These forces include gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces.
Net force is the combined effect of all the forces acting on an object. To find the strength of the net force, add forces that act in the same direction and subtract forces that act in opposite directions

### Newton's third law

- When an object $A$ puts a force on object $B$, object $B$ puts an _equal and opposite_ force on object $A$ (amount, direction are opposite)
- In other words, _when two objects interact, they push against each other in opposite directions_
- When two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are always the same strength, and they always act in opposite directions
- **Forces always come in pairs**, equal to each other: why don't they cancel each other out? _That's because they are acting on different objects (i.e. mass, size)_

### Newton's first law

- If the net force on an object is zero, the object's motion will not change (i.e. the object will not accelerate)

### Newton's second law

- If the net force on an object is _not_ zero, the object's motion _will_ change (i.e. the object will accelerate)
- A net force causes acceleration (!)
- $accelaration = \frac{net force}{mass}$

---

- Unbalanced forces $\leftrightarrow$ change in velocity
- Balanced forces $\leftrightarrow$ no change in velocity
- If an unbalanced force is applied to an object, the object's velocity will change
- But a change in velocity could mean speeding up, slowing down, and/or changing direction
- Which of these does an unbalanced force cause?
- The answer depends on the direction the net force acts, compared to the direction the object is moving
  - If the net force acts in the same direction the object is moving, the object speeds up
  - If the net force acts opposite the direction the object is moving, the object slows down
  - If the net force acts at an angle compared to the direction the object is moving, the object changes direction
- An object’s acceleration is its change in velocity per unit of time
- If the same strength net force is applied to different mass objects, those with greater mass will experience smaller accelerations
- A stronger net force will cause a greater acceleration for an object with constant mass
- A greater mass object will undergo a smaller acceleration for the same strength net force applied

---

- Newton's first law tells us that when the forces on an object are unbalanced its velocity changes
- When the forces are balanced its velocity does not change
- An unbalanced force can cause an object to speed up, slow down, and/or change direction
- The result depends on the direction the unbalanced force acts compared with the direction the object is moving
- An object's acceleration—how quickly its velocity changes—depends on the strength of the net force exerted on it
- A stronger net force causes a greater acceleration if the object's mass stays the same
- An object's acceleration also depends on its mass
- The same strength net force applied to a larger mass will produce a smaller acceleration
- To accelerate different-mass objects at the same rate, the larger mass must experience a larger net force
- Newton's second law tells us how an object's acceleration depends on its mass and the strength of the net force exerted on it
- It can be expressed as an equation: $accelaration = \frac{net force}{mass}$

## Non-contact interactions

### Gravitational force

- Is a fundamental force
- Gravity: a force of attraction between any two masses
- Fundamental force of attraction between any two masses
- Non-contact force, mediated via gravitational fields
- Strength depends on masses
- Gets weaker with distance

---

- As with all forces, gravitational forces only exist when there's an interaction between two objects
- Two masses interact without contact through a gravitational field
- Gravitational forces are always attractive — two interacting masses always exert gravitational forces on each other that pull towards each other
- This is true no matter how the masses are arranged, how they may be moving, or how they may be interacting with other objects
- Increasing mass causes the gravitational forces to get stronger
- It doesn't matter whether we increase mass 1 or mass 2 — we'd get the same result either way
- If we increased both masses, the gravitational force strength would increase even more
- Gravitational force is a very weak force
- So, gravitational forces are very small unless one or both of the masses are very large
- Increasing the distance between masses causes the gravitational forces to get weaker

---

- Two masses interact without contact through a gravitational field
- The gravitational forces two masses exert on each other are always attractive, meaning the forces pull the objects toward each other
- The more massive one or both of the masses are, the stronger the gravitational forces are
- The farther apart the centers of the masses are, the weaker the gravitational forces are
- Astronauts and other falling objects experience weightlessness
- This is NOT because there's no gravitational force acting on them
- Instead, it's because there's no surface pushing against them to create the sensation of weight

### Electric and magnetic forces

- Electromagnetic forces: tension, friction, normal force
- Electric force: force between charge particles (postive, negative charge)
- Every charge/charge particles produce electric fields
- This electric field puts a force on other charges
- Electric force:
  - Charge particles exert electric forces on each other
  - Like charges repel
  - Unlike charges attract
  - More charge means stronger electric force
  - Electric force decreases with distance
- Magnetic force:
  - Part of the fundamental electromagnetic interaction
  - Non-contact force
  - Unlike poles attract
  - Like poles repel
  - Stronger magnets exert more force
  - Magnetic force gets weaker with distance
- More currents in electromagnets exert more force

---

- Fundamentally, electric and magnetic forces are both part of the single electromagnetic force
- The electromagnetic force acts without contact through the electromagnetic field
- Electric charge can be either positive (+) or negative (-)
- Electric charge is the property of matter that makes it interact electromagnetically
- Electric charges always produce electric fields
- Electric charges in an electric field always experience a force
- Electric charges produce magnetic fields when the charges are moving
- Electric charges in a magnetic field experience a force when the charges are moving
- Electric charges and electromagnetic fields affect each other

---

- Electric charges interact without contact through electric fields
- If another charged particle enters the electric field, it will experience an electric force
- The forces two charges exert on each other can be either repulsive or attractive
- Like (same) charges repel each other, and unlike (opposite) charges attract each other

---

- Electromagnetic induction: a changing magnetic field produces an electric field
- This electric field leads to a force on the electrons in the coil, which makes the electrons move and produces electric current
- Electromagnetic induction allows us to produce electric current, which we can use to power our electric devices
- But for this to work, we need the magnetic field through a coil to change continuously

---

- It’s also true that an electric current-electrons in motion—produces a magnetic field
- This is how electromagnets work

---

- Matter is made of particles
- Some of those particles have a property called electric charge
- Electric charge can be either positive (+) or negative (-)
- Electric charges and electromagnetic fields affect each other
- Electric charges interact without contact through electric fields
- Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other
- Charges, such as electrons, flowing over time is called electric current
- Magnets interact without contact through magnetic fields
- Every magnet has $N$ and $S$ pole
- Like poles repel each other and opposite poles attract each other
- During electromagnetic induction, a changing magnetic field produces an electric field
- This electric field leads to a force on electrons in a coil, which makes the electrons move and produces electric current
- This is how electric generators work
- Electric currents produce magnetic fields
- This is how electromagnets work
- Electric currents also experience a force when passing through a magnetic field
- This is how electric motors work

## Energy

- Energy: quanitity measured in joules ($J$)

### Kinetic energy

- Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion
- How much kinetic energy an object has depends on two factors: the mass of the object, and the speed of the object
  - Kinetic energy increases linearly with the mass
  - Kinetic energy increases with the square of speed
